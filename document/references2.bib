	abstract     = {Implementing solutions for optimisation problems with general-purpose programming languages is a time consuming task that can only be carried out by professional software developers who typically are not domain experts. We address this problem by developing the domain-specific language Athos that allows to declaratively specify models of problems such as the vehicle routing problem with time windows. These models serve as input to a generator that creates programs to solve the modelled problem in a multi-agent environment (NetLogo) which is further extended with a genetic algorithm optimiser.We discuss the overall Athos architecture and compare the source models with the generated code to demonstrate the benefit for developers. Furthermore, we present a qualitative assessment of the language by applying selected aspects of the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework.Beyond the quality criteria discussed in this paper future work will include extensive field experiments in which domain experts will apply Athos to their practical problems. A formal evaluation process will help to improve the usability and applicability of the language.},

This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

This chapter will cover discussions on the design and implementation of wearable devices for different applications such as real-time detection of heart attack, abnormal heart sound, blood pressure monitoring, gait analysis for diabetic foot monitoring. This chapter will also cover how the signals acquired from these prototypes can be used for training machine learning (ML) algorithm to diagnose the condition of the person wearing the device. This chapter discusses the steps involved in (i) hardware design including sensors selection, characterization, signal acquisition, and communication to decision-making subsystem and (ii) the ML algorithm design including feature extraction, feature reduction, training, and testing. This chapter will use the case study of the design of smart insole for diabetic foot monitoring, wearable real-time heart attack detection, and smart-digital stethoscope system to show the steps involved in the development of wearable biomedical systems.},

	abstract     = {Effectively and efficiently diagnosing COVID-19 patients with accurate clinical type is essential to achieve optimal outcomes for the patients as well as reducing the risk of overloading the healthcare system. Currently, severe and non-severe COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few features, which do not comprehensively characterize the complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion in different types. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe and 148 in severe type, from Wuhan, China. The patients’ comorbidity and symptoms (including 26 features), and laboratory testing results (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest (RF) models based on features in each modality were developed and validated to classify COVID-19 clinical types. Using comorbidity/symptom and laboratory results as input independently, RF models achieved {\textgreater}90\% and {\textgreater}95\% predictive accuracy, respectively. Input features’ importance based on Gini impurity were further evaluated and top five features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, diabetes; D-Dimer, hsTNI, absolute neutrophil count, IL-6, and LDH, in descending order). Combining top 10 multimodal features, RF model achieved {\textgreater}99\% predictive accuracy. These findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 invasion as a unity and provide insights on effectively evaluating COVID-19 patient’s severity and developing personalized treatment plans accordingly. We suggest that symptoms and comorbidities can be used as an initial screening tool for triaging, while laboratory results are applied when accuracy is the priority.Funding Statement: This study was jointly supported by the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (81703201), the Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Jiangsu Province (BK20171076), the Jiangsu Provincial Medical Innovation Team (CXTDA2017029), the Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent program (QNRC2016548), the Jiangsu Preventive Medicine Association program (Y2018086), the Lifting Program of Jiangsu Provincial Scientific and Technological Association, and the Jiangsu Government Scholarship for Overseas Studies.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests in this study.Ethics Approval Statement: Patient-specific identifying information (e.g., name, address of residence) was removed from data collected for this study.

	abstract     = {The recent outbreak of the respiratory ailment COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 is a severe and urgent global concern. In the absence of effective treatments, the main containment strategy is to reduce the contagion by the isolation of infected individuals; however, isolation of unaffected individuals is highly undesirable. To help make rapid decisions on treatment and isolation needs, it would be useful to determine which features presented by suspected infection cases are the best predictors of a positive diagnosis. This can be done by analyzing patient characteristics, case trajectory, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes. We developed a model that employed supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the presentation features predicting COVID-19 disease diagnoses with high accuracy. Features examined included details of the individuals concerned, e.g., age, gender, observation of fever, history of travel, and clinical details such as the severity of cough and incidence of lung infection. We implemented and applied several machine learning algorithms to our collected data and found that the XGBoost algorithm performed with the highest accuracy (>85%) to predict and select features that correctly indicate COVID-19 status for all age groups. Statistical analyses revealed that the most frequent and significant predictive symptoms are fever (41.1%), cough (30.3%), lung infection (13.1%) and runny nose (8.43%). While 54.4% of people examined did not develop any symptoms that could be used for diagnosis, our work indicates that for the remainder, our predictive model could significantly improve the prediction of COVID-19 status, including at early stages of infection.},

	abstract     = {Providing appropriate care for people suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a significant global challenge. Many individuals who become infected may have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative regarding the individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Determining the degree to which comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision. To assess this we performed a meta-analysis of published global literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Our meta-analysis suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictors of mortality, in terms of symptom–comorbidity combinations, it was observed that Pneumonia–Hypertension, Pneumonia–Diabetes, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)–Hypertension showed the most significant associations with COVID-19 mortality. These results highlight the patient cohorts most likely to be at risk of COVID-19-related severe morbidity and mortality, which have implications for prioritization of hospital resources.},

Prediction models that combine several features to estimate the risk of infection have been developed. These aim to assist medical staff worldwide in triaging patients, especially in the context of limited healthcare resources. We established a machine-learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4769 were confirmed to have COVID-19). The test set contained data from the subsequent week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3624 were confirmed to have COVID-19). Our model predicted COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight binary features: sex, age ≥60 years, known contact with an infected individual, and the appearance of five initial clinical symptoms. Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions. Our framework can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for COVID-19 when testing resources are limited.},

The sampling approach is called the bootstrap, which adopts a random sampling approach with replacement. The subspace method also adopts a random sampling approach, but it helps extract smaller subsets (i.e., subspaces) of features. It also helps build decision trees based on them and select decision trees for the random forest construction. The ensemble approach helps build classifiers based on the so-called bagging approach.
